A happier person has a lower risk for cardiovascular disease, has lower blood pressure, has a reduced amount of stress, gets better sleep, and generally lives longer than the average person.1 Although there isn’t a perfect formula to attain happiness, there are general trends that one could follow to have a pretty decent chance at increasing one’s happiness. A medically-reviewed paper from PsychCentral says that being driven, achieving long-term goals, and having meaningful relationships usually lead to a significant improvement on a person’s happiness.2 According to Edward Diener, a Senior Scientist who belongs to the Gallup Organization, the scientific term for happiness and general life satisfaction is subjective well-being.3 This is when people think that their life is going well compared to how bad it could be. To Diener, there are internal and external causes for influences a person’s happiness. The internal factors stem from a person’s inborn temperament, personality, and other psychological aspects. The external factors, however, point toward whether a person has sufficient financial resources or not. We will be exploring in detail the external influences through statistical point of view. In this article, we pull data from the World Happiness Report as the basis for our analysis when looking at national levels of happiness.4 The research question we aim to answer is, “What external influences affect happiness and by how much?” Although we can’t give a concrete answer on the pursuit of happiness, we can take a step towards the right direction using statistics.

The reason behind choosing the years in the most recent decade is in an attempt to gather up-to-date measures. The World Happiness Report of a certain year calculates the Happiness Index based on the average of the previous three years’ surveys. For example, the World Happiness Report 2015 is calculated from the average of the year 2012 to 2014 datasets. The happiness score is measured through self-reported surveys that ask the question, “How would you rate your happiness on a scale of 0 to 10 where 10 is the happiest?”. These surveys are representative of 80% or more of the population of a country and also account specifically for people who are 15 or older. A major limitation to this method of gathering data, however, is it can be biased at times. With different countries, there are bound to be different cultural and societal influences on the citizens’ mindsets that result in different standards in evaluating one’s happiness level. This is why it can be more scientific to refer to happiness as subjective well-being instead. Visit the Gallup World Poll website, the main source of information for the World Happiness Report, for detailed information on how the data was obtained.5 In the reports, the Happiness Index can be explained by the following six key factors: economy (GDP per Capita), family, health (Life Expectancy), freedom, and government trust. However, the six factors added together are equal to the happiness score and consequently violate the No Perfect Collinearity Assumption if we attempt to run any regressions on the data. In our effort to prevent the said violation, we keep the Happiness_score variable from the World Happiness Report (2014-2018) as our response variable and extract other independent variables from the World Bank Group. The World Bank Group database provides open-source data that contains a comprehensive amount of information about many countries’ development.6 We will explore the subjective well-being of people in 150 countries across the world with the combination of the World Happiness Report and World Bank Group between 2015 and 2018.7 We merge the data across four years in order to measure the changes over time. This, in effect, also reduces random sampling errors by obtaining a larger sample size. The* World Bank Group* categorizes its data into twenty comprehensive indicators. The variables we choose to further explore are selected from the following five indicators: Health, Gender, Climate Change, Urban Development, and Economy &amp; Growth. Electricity, as one of our five independent variables, is a part of the Climate Change Indicator. This variable represents the percentage of people in each country that have access to electricity. In countries with higher percentages of people having electricity, people might be able to use entertainment devices such as TV and computers, which in turn could influence their state of mind, including feeling happy. PopDensity, categorized as a part of Urban Development Indicator, represents the density of the population of each country. It’s calculated by dividing the amount of people over the total sq. km of land area. The denser areas could lead to a lack of food supplies or medical resources, and that might decrease people’s trust in the government, which reflects back at the happiness score. The gdpGrowth variable, categorized into the Economy &amp; Growth Indicator, contains the annual percentage growth rate of GDP from each country based on the constant 2010 U.S. dollars. The inclusion of the gdpGrowth variable is based on our prediction that in developing countries like Vietnam, a higher GDP growth rate might negatively affect the population’s overall happiness due to an intensive working environment. Vietnam, as a developing country, experiences a GDP growth rate of ~3% higher than the mean average during the observed time period. However, with this fact alone, we can’t jump to any conclusion without running any regression models. In the Health Indicator of the World Bank Group, lifeExp is the nuthember of years an infant is expected to live, given that the prevailing patterns of mortality rate at the birthdate stays constant for the entirety of the infant’s life. In the previous section, we talked about the positive effects that happiness can bring to us. Being able to live a longer life is mentioned at the start as one of the positive effects from being happy. This suggests a possible relationship between an individual’s health and happiness, which we’ll apply OLS and Fixed Effects to find out later on. PctMale, as part of the Gender Indicator, contains the percentage of the male population in each country. We took into account gender in our studies due to a possible reasoning that concerns gender inequality. The larger percentage of the male population could influence the inequality in wages for the opposite gender and that would eventually lead to a decrease in happiness. Statistic N Mean St. Dev.

Summary statistics describing the number of observations, mean value, standard deviation, minimum, maximum, median, and 25 and 75 percentile range for the explanatory variables. In Table 1, there are a total of 590 observations across 4 years (2015-2018) that contains 150 unique countries. For a better interpretation of the outcome variable, we multiply the Happiness_score by 10, which converts it into a 0-100 scale. The average Happiness_score worldwide between that time period is 53.86 out of 100, which is less than what we expected. We assumed a score of 70 would be more than reasonable, nonetheless, our incorrect guess simply demonstrates how subjective happiness can be. Switzerland, Iceland, Denmark, and Norway were the only countries that maintained their top 5 rankings of the happiness score across all four years and Finland was able to maintain their top 5 ranking for three years. Among these happiest countries in the world, they all have a happiness score of 70 or above and Finland has the highest score of 76.32. Out of the 150 countries that are available in our data throughout the 4 years, there are 110 countries that have a happiness of below 60. In our study, we only include the gdpGrowth for 2015-2018. Four years is a small-time period, which is hard to reflect any major changes unless certain special events like natural disasters impact the countries. The average increase of 3.217% of gdpGrowth is within our expected range. The mean for PopDensity is 246.775, which is extremely small compared to the max of 7,952.99. This shows that there is a wide range of population density across the world and some of the countries with more concentrated populations are bringing the mean up considerably. The opposite happens with the Electricity variable. There are many countries that have complete access to electricity, but some countries with really low percentages bring the mean down. Some countries in the central part of Africa have values around 8 to 10%, which bring the mean down to 83.8%. In the following section, we introduce the econometric methods that help us examine the explanatory variables and how much they correlate with Happiness_score. Referenced Gallup World Poll↩︎ Referenced World Bank Group↩︎ World Bank contains over 190 countries. However, after combining data from World Bank and World Happiness Report, the dataset outputted 150 countries with intact information.↩︎ "],["results.html", "3 Results", " 3 Results We created four models using OLS and Fixed Effects to explore variables. In the Ordinary Least Squares (OLS) model, the Multiple Linear Regression (MLR) relationship between different measurements is expressed.8 The OLS method, however, is only useful when its limitations are removed. If the OLS doesn’t abide by the assumptions of linear regression, then the estimates we get would be skewed. The coefficient estimates used to multiply with the gdpGrowth, LifeExp, PctMale, PopDensity, and Electricity variables and added up are expressed in a linear equation which holds true the Linear in Parameters Assumption. Moreover, the data gathered is a random sample of 150 unique countries from 2015 to 2018, with a total of 590 observations, which should satisfy the Random Sampling Assumption. Regarding the No Perfect Collinearity Assumption, the independent variables gdpGrowth, LifeExp, PctMale, PopDensity, and Electricity aren’t constant nor perfectly correlated. The Zero Conditional Mean Assumption must also be held true. Given any value of the gdpGrowth, LifeExp, PctMale, PopDensity, and Electricity variables, the expected value of error, \\((u)\\), should be equal to 0. To further observe how much influence the unobservable factors have on Happiness_score, we apply Fixed Effects. For the Country Fixed Effects model, we are essentially placing the country as a dummy variable.9 By doing so, it allows us to look at the change within each country while holding constant unobservable factors that are time-constant in that specific country over the 4 years. The Year Fixed Effects model, on the other hand, places the year as a dummy variable.10 The model holds the unobservable factors that are the same for all countries within each year constant. The last model uses Country-Year Fixed Effects which places both the year and the country as dummy variables.11 Dependent variable: Happiness_score OLS panel linear (OLS) (Country FE) (Year FE) (Country-Year FE) gdpGrowth -0.089 -0.029 -0.085 -0.036 p = 0.271 p = 0.385 p = 0.298 p = 0.273 lifeExp 1.030*** -0.333 1.031*** -1.614*** p = 0.000 p = 0.242 p = 0.000 p = 0.0004 PctMale 0.291*** -0.472 0.291*** -0.544 p = 0.002 p = 0.616 p = 0.002 p = 0.558 PopDensity -0.001*** 0.004 -0.001*** -0.002 p = 0.008 p = 0.641 p = 0.008 p = 0.791 Electricity 0.037* 0.012 0.037* 0.025 p = 0.059 p = 0.766 p = 0.059 p = 0.527 factor(Year)2016 0.337 p = 0.198 factor(Year)2017 0.810** p = 0.013 factor(Year)2018 1.468*** p = 0.0003 Constant -38.039*** p = 0.000 Observations 597 597 597 597 R2 0.609 0.006 0.609 0.041 Adjusted R2 0.605 -0.346 0.604 -0.308 Note: *p&lt;0.1;**p&lt;0.05;***p&lt;0.01 Table 2. Results showing the coefficient estimates and the p-values of explanatory variables for the four models mentioned above. In the OLS model, it shows statistically significant coefficient estimates for all explanatory variables at either 1% or 5% level. The Electricity variable suggests every percentage point increase of electricity access would increase the Happiness_score by 0.037. This is significant at the 5% level (p-value = 0.046). This result meets with our expectation in which area with high electricity coverage tends to be happier, because people might be able to use entertainment devices such as TV and computers. However, the gdpGrowth coefficient shows an opposite relationship to what we expect. Every percentage point increase in gdpGrowth would result in a decrease of 0.162 in the Happiness_score. This is an indication of a negative relationship between the gdpGowth and people’s happiness, which doesn’t make much logical sense. This contradiction might be due to the self-evaluated surveys. The Country Fixed Effects model makes each country a dummy variable, ending up generates 150 different coefficient estimates, one for each country. This holds constant all factors that do not change within a country between 2015 and 2018. This is useful to look to observe how the variables affect each country individually and compare the differences between countries. For our purposes, we decided not to show all 150 country coefficients in Table 2 and instead show the one that represents the average of all countries. The only statistically significant coefficient in this model is lifeExp because it is the only variable in which we can reject the null hypothesis due to the p-value being under 0.05. The -0.534 value for the coefficient indicates that each year increase in lifeExp would result in an average decrease of 0.534 in Happiness_score for any specific country. The other variables have large p-values, meaning that the results could have been due to chance and they are not statistically significant. The problem with this model is that the \\(R^2\\) is very small at 0.011, meaning that this model only explains ~1% of the variation in the data. This makes this model irrelevant, so if we want actual results we should not focus on this model. While the Country Fixed Effects model is able to remove all the time-constant unobservables within each country, it fails to take into account any of the shared unobservable factors across all countries within each year. Year Fixed Effects model would allow us to do exactly that by making the year as the only dummy variable. The coefficient estimates for gdpGrowth in the Year Fixed Effects model is the second lowest out of the four models, sitting at -0.158. We thought this was counterintuitive because one would attribute economic growth to overall general happiness. Clearly, there are other factors at play that cause the decrease of Happiness_score. One of the reasons could be the fact that poorer countries tend to have a higher annual growth than richer countries, and people in poorer countries generally have worse living conditions, causing unhappiness. There could be dozens of other reasons, but now we know that gdpGrowth is not associated with a national feeling of life satisfaction. This result reflects our prediction in which a higher GDP growth rate might negatively affect the population’s overall happiness due to an intensive working environment. In the Country and Year Fixed Effects model, there are a total of 590 dummy variables created. Although there are 150 variables and 4 years, there wouldn’t be 600 variables because some countries are only accounted for 3 years instead of 4. The coefficients shown in the model are the average of all 590 coefficients. By looking at each coefficient, we notice that lifeExp is the only variable that has a statistically significant coefficient at 1% level. For every year increase in lifeExp, we can see a decrease of 1.981 in Happiness_score. This suggests lifeExp has a negative correlation with Happiness_score. In our previous prediction, being able to live a longer life means happier, but in our results table, the prediction false, and there might’ve been be some other unobservables that influence the result we haven’t taken into account. Also,to note, just as the Country Fixed Effects model, the Country and Year Fixed Effects model has a small \\(R^2\\) of 5% which means only 5% of the variation in data is explained by the model. For analytical purposes, this model should not be considered. \\(HappinessScore_{it} = \\beta_0+\\beta_1 gdpGrowth_{it} + \\beta_2 lifeExp_{it} + \\beta_3 PctMale_{it} + \\beta_4 PopDensity_{it} + \\beta_5 Electricity_{it} + v_{it}\\)↩︎ \\(HappinessScore_{it} = \\beta_0+\\beta_1 gdpGrowth_{it} + \\beta_2 lifeExp_{it} + \\beta_3 PctMale_{it} + \\beta_4 PopDensity_{it} + \\beta_5 Electricity_{it} + \\sum_{i=2}^{150}\\sigma_idC_i + u_{it}\\)↩︎ \\(HappinessScore_{it} = \\beta_0+\\beta_1 gdpGrowth_{it} + \\beta_2 lifeExp_{it} + \\beta_3 PctMale_{it} + \\beta_4 PopDensity_{it} + \\beta_5 Electricity_{it} + \\sum_{t=2015}^{2018}\\gamma_tdY_t + u_{it}\\)↩︎ \\(HappinessScore_{it} = \\beta_0+\\beta_1 gdpGrowth_{it} + \\beta_2 lifeExp_{it} + \\beta_3 PctMale_{it} + \\beta_4 PopDensity_{it} + \\beta_5 Electricity_{it} + \\sum_{i=2}^{150}\\sigma_idC_i + \\sum_{t=2015}^{2018}\\gamma_tdY_t + u_{it}\\)↩︎ "],["conclusion.html", "4 Conclusion", " 4 Conclusion The question we aimed to answer before starting our research was, “What external influences affect happiness of people and by how much?”. There are many reasons why we can’t give a conclusive answer with our research. Firstly, there is a large number of unobservable variables when it comes to happiness. We’re certain that the 5 variables we chose are not the only contributing factors to happiness. The answers people give to the question, “How would you rate your happiness on a scale of 0 to 10 where 10 is the happiest?”, are largely dependent on their specific country, culture, mentality, and perception. A clear example of subjective well-being can be seen with how people handle access to electricity. For some, electricity may not be a requirement to achieve maximum life satisfaction, but others may be content without it. The answer to the happiness question could largely depend on where the person is from.. Therefore, the answers that people in developing countries give to the happiness survey might actually be higher compared to the first-world countries and in turn, skew the results. These skewed results can be seen with the counterintuitive results that were given by the lifeExp variable in the Country Fixed Effects and Country-Year Fixed Effects models. The coefficients being negative for these models but not for the OLS or Year Fixed Effects models put in display the large discrepancies between an individual country’s happiness and its life expectancy. These interesting results are what made us realize how different external influences could be depending on the country. We think that after seeing results like these, a worthwhile area of research to visit is the difference in cultures around the world and how they affect one’s own judgement of happiness. A study on Culture and Happiness strengthens this point. According to Ye, Ng, and Lian, “Culture may be the main factor for country fixed effects. The empirical results show that culture variables have significant effects in the regression on selective well being, suggesting that culture is an important explanatory variable for selective well being.”12 These observations show how important it is to take into account important external influences such as culture, race, politics, human rights, and social class when looking into a national level of subjective well-being.
